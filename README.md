# Extended Altar of Ashes
## Version 1 by Mehaz

### Features:
- Adds Heroic and Legendary upgrade tiers to each of the cards with scaling and unique costs. (Note: You still must unlock card upgrades through regular progression).
- Increases maximum Grasp to 62, and adds scaling and unique costs up to the maximum.

- In order to easily uninstall the mod, or upgrade your save through a Supergiant patch:
- Attempt to upgrade an Arcana card that is above Epic without the required materials or at Max Rank to refund it back to Epic.
- Attempt to increase your Grasp above 30 without the required materials or at Max Rank to refund it back to 30 Grasp.

### WIP Goals:
- Currently, XII Eternity (Death Defiances) and XXIII The Artificer (Minor Find -> Major Find) do not have a Legendary upgrade due to them being implemented differently in the code.
- Add another tier of upgrades.
- Support the mod through Early Access.
- Take your feedback into account for the future of the mod.

This mod is compatible with Hell2Modding & ModImporter.

#### Note:
- I designed the prices based on what I like (scaling prices for excessive power, Grasp is a long grind).
- If you don't like the prices I made and want to change them, go to
ExtendedAltarOfAshes/MetaUpgradeData.lua and change them yourself!
- The Arcana cards are listed in order from I -> XXV in the file, in case it's confusing.

For your convenience:
- MemPointsCommon = Psyche
- Mixer6Common = Darkness
- MixerFBoss = Cinder
- MixerGBoss = Pearl
- MixerHBoss = Tears
- MixerIBoss = Zodiac Sand
- MixerNBoss = Wool
- MixerOBoss = GoldenApple
- CardUpgradePoints = Moon Dust
- WeaponPointsRare = Nightmare
- ... and everything else is fairly self-explanatory.
